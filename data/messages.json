As a fellow Trojan, I was excited to see your role as a University Recruiter at Meta. I'm eager to learn more about career paths at Meta for students interested in tech, and I'd love to hear about your experience. Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call sometime in the next few weeks?\n\nThanks for your time and consideration.\n\nBest,\n\nEvan\n\n\n[Email sent successfully ✓]\n\n[Email sent successfully ✓]"
